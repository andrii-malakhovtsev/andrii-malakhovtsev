### Hi there, I'm Andrii Malakhovtsev ✌

- I'm a student from Ukraine who had to move to US (Dayton, OH) because of the war!
- I was studying in I. I. Mechnikov Odesa National University 🎓 in the "Information systems and technology" specialty, but unfortunately had to leave.
- Now I'm open to new opportunities in programming jobs! ⚒
